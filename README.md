# Rick Russell Ceramic Tiler - User Centric Frontend Milestone Project
## Overview
As part of the Code Institute Full Stack Web Developer course, I was tasked with building a mobile-first responsive website for my first project. 
I decided to create a website for an experienced, self-employed ceramic tiler called Rick Russell. 
It not only provides him with an online presence where potential customers can contact him for work, but also promotes his services and encourages potential customers to request a quote. 
The website is a single page starting with a landing page, and scrolling down the page will take you to Testimonials, an About Rick section, a photo Gallery, and finally a Contact Rick form. 
There is also a footer with social media links.

The website utilises the frontend skills I have learnt in the first two modules of the course. 
It is responsive across different devices, with some extra content appearing on larger resolutions. 
These include extra testimonials, customer photographs, extra text in the About Rick section, and a larger selection of images in the gallery. 
At the top of the page is a fixed navigation bar, that allows the user to navigate to the different sections of the page with a click. 
On mobile resolutions the bar collapses to a "burger menu" button.
## UX
My full UX documentation can be found in the ux-design folder. 
This includes a document detailing my thoughts on the strategy and scope planes of this project, plus the basic structure and my skeleton wireframes.

### User Stories

* As a potential customer of Rick Russell, I want to be able to contact him so that I can request his services and/or a quote.
* As a potential customer who yet to be convinced, I want to read what other customers have to say about his services so that I can make up my mind.
* As someone looking to have their bathroom tiled, I want to be able to view images of bathrooms Rick has tiled to assess the quality and come up with ideas.
* As a business owner, I want to be able to find out more about Rick Russell before I consider hiring him for a job, as I want to know that he is someone I can trust.
